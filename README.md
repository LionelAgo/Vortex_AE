How to exploit an Auto-encoder for exploring and predicting  flow dynamic
## Introduction
The dynamic associated to flow motion, it is in most case  highly-dimensional, strongly non-linear and populated by large spectre of spatio-temporal coherent structures. This complexity renders the study of fluid dynamic system extremely fascinating. As the field of fluid mechanics being in the enviable position of having the Navier-Stokes equations, one could assume that the flow motions can be perfectly predicted in principle through these equations (Laplaceâ€™s determinism). However, as N-S equations are also composed by no-linear terms, resolving these equations prove to be extremely complex and even impossible. For example for any viscous fluid in motion relative to a solid, as the fluid velocity decreases to zero at the wall, a shear layer is induced. this latter leads to the formation of chaotic turbulent structures within a wide spectrum of length and time scales; and the stronger the shear layer is, richer and more complex is the dynamics.
